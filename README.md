The project can be seen in my video https://youtu.be/vvA7vfouk84

The project has been tested on the DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1 (with ES8388)

After uploading the firmware you should hear the metronome.
The software will be automatically in recoding mode.
Please do not forget to upload the data using the littleFs data upload.
The files will be mapped to the keys.
